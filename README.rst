Tygs
====

Tygs wants to be a Pure Python Web framework providing a sweet API for :

- easy asynchronous HTTP;
- PUB/SUB between your code on: server/server, server-client, client-client;
- PUB/SUB between your code on: server/server, server-client, client-client;
- easy task queues;
- in memory key/value store for caching and more;
- multiprocessing to bypass the GIL and still play nice and easy with the above.

For now it's nothing, since the project just started. No promises.
